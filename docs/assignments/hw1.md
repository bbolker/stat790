## homework 1

**Due date**: Friday Jan 20 (midnight)

All homework should be submitted by pushing it to your GitHub repo and sending me and Greg Forkutza a note on Piazza to say that you've done it. Please make sure that all code is **reproducible**, e.g. specify what packages are loaded; don't use any absolute paths; etc.. (You can assume that the zipcode files for problem 2.8 are available in the current working directory.)  See also my [R Style guide](https://bbolker.github.io/stat790/R_style.html). Test any homework code by re-running it in a clean R session.

Homework submission as LaTeX/Rmarkdown/Quarto with LaTeX inclusions is **strongly** preferred.

1. Write a short (2-3 sentence) description of any opinions, thoughts, or questions you are left with after reading Breiman (2001) and one of the responses to it.

3. ADA problem 1.2

4. ADA problem 1.7

5. ADA problem 1.8

6. ESL problem 2.8
