title: "software installation"

*Note*: some people use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) stack to manage their installations of Python (and other languages). It is slightly notorious for not playing nicely with other software; if you use it I'm happy for you but you may have to find Anaconda-specific instructions for installing all the bits and pieces below.

## Git

* https://git-scm.com/downloads/
* install Git (https://happygitwithr.com/ has instructions designed around R/RStudio; 
* https://www.jcchouinard.com/install-git-in-vscode/ has VSCode-centred instructions

## Github

* get a Github user name (if you don't have one already)
* create a repository called `stat790`
* add me as a collaborator (Settings > Collaborators > enter `bbolker`)
* https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview

## R

* https://mirror.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/CRAN/ or https://cloud.r-project.org/

## Julia

* https://julialang.org/downloads/

## Quarto

* https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/

## VSCode

* https://code.visualstudio.com/download
* (`sudo apt install code -y` on recent Debian-based linux)

## R and Julia support

* open VSCode, go to Extensions
   * Julia
   * R (install `languageserver` package in R)
   * (because I'm weird) Awesome Emacs 

## extras

* recommended `radian` R console (also need Python installed!) `pip install radian`; update settings. See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r
