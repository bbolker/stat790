## Logistics

* (almost) everything at course web page, https://bbolker.github.io/stat790
* Zoom link: https://tinyurl.com/stat790-zoom-2023
* communication/forums (TBD)
* assignment marks (TBD)

## Integrity

* [notes on honesty](../honesty.html)
* why copying code is good
* Stack Overflow and ChatGPT
* group work, copying

## Goals

* understand theory behind (novel) SL/ML methods
* read papers
* (choose methods)
* implement methods
* read/understand/improve existing methods

## Technical skills & tools

* reproducibility: version control (Git/GitHub)
* machinery
   * R, Julia
	* VSCode
   * Unix shell?
	* reproducibility: Quarto/Sweave/Jupyter notebooks
* *command line bullshittery* ("bullshit (read: diagnosing and debugging weird things) is a part of life in the world of computers") [@adarValue2015]

## About me

* weird background (physics u/g, Zoology PhD, epidemiological modeling)
* biases/interests:
   * scientific answers vs. prediction only (but see @navarroScience2019)
   * generative models
   * data visualization
   * solving problems in context, practical issues
   * rants (p-values, snooping, dichotomization, unbalanced categorical responses ...)

# Themes

## Bias/variance tradeoff

* under/overfitting, Goldilocks
   * shrinkage, regularization, penalization, dropout (neural networks), tree depth, learning rate (boosting), early stopping, priors ...

## basis construction/feature engineering

* splines, Gaussian processes, tree splits, wavelets, Fourier bases, neural network architecture ...

## optimization

* (stochastic) gradient descent
* iterative methods
   * IRLS (iteratively reweighted least squares), expectation-maximization
   * quasi-Newton (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno)

## quantifying accuracy and uncertainty

* train/validate/test: cross-validation (blocked, etc.)
* bootstrap

## sparsity

* dimension reduction
    * structural zeros within vectors or matrices  
    e.g. adjacency matrices
    * reduced-rank matrices
* computational efficiency
* a means to an end
