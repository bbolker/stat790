## integrity

* Stack Overflow and ChatGPT
* group work, copying

## technical skills/tools

* reproducibility: version control (Github)
* machinery
    * R, Julia
	* VScode
	* reproducibility: Quarto or Sweave or Jupyter notebook

## Goals

* understand theory behind (novel) methods
* read papers
* (choose methods)
* implement methods
* read/understand/improve existing methods

## About me

* weird background (physics u/g, Zoology PhD, epidemiological modeling)
* biases:
* interested in scientific answers (but see @navarroScience2019)

## Themes

* preventing overfitting
   * shrinkage
   * regularization
   * penalization
   * dropouts (NN)
   * constraining tree depth 
   * learning rate (boosting)
   * early stopping
   * priors
* basis construction/feature engineering
   * splines
   * GPs
   * tree splits
   * wavelets
   * Fourier bases
   * neural network architecture
* optimization
   * gradient descent, SGD
   * IRLS
   * BFGS etc.
* 
* loss functions
* assessment and diagnostics
   * cross-validation (blocked, etc.)
   * bootstrap
