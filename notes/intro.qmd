## integrity

* Stack Overflow and ChatGPT
* group work, copying

## technical skills/tools

* reproducibility: version control (Github)
* machinery
    * R, Julia
	* VSCode
	* reproducibility: Quarto or Sweave or Jupyter notebook
* *command line bullshittery* ("bullshit (read: diagnosing and debugging weird things) is a part of life in the world of computers") [@adarValue2015]


## Goals

* understand theory behind (novel) methods
* read papers
* (choose methods)
* implement methods
* read/understand/improve existing methods

## About me

* weird background (physics u/g, Zoology PhD, epidemiological modeling)
* biases:
* interested in scientific answers (but see @navarroScience2019)

## Themes

* preventing overfitting
   * shrinkage
   * regularization
   * penalization
   * dropouts (NN)
   * constraining tree depth 
   * learning rate (boosting)
   * early stopping
